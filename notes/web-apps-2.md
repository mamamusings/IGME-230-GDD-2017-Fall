## I. <a id="section1"></a>Introduction
If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS, you are already familiar with the basics of getting browser layout engines to display your web pages the way you want them to look.
But to give yourself even more control over the appearance of your web pages, as well as other capabilities, you will need to utilize the JavaScript programming language.

JavaScript was originally created by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communication in 1995, and was re-implemented as JScript in Microsoft Internet Explorer in 1996.

Standardization of the language began in 1996 when Netscape submitted the language to Ecma International (at the time, "European Computer Manufacturers Association").

The term JavaScript is actually trademarked by the Oracle Corporation, so the standardized name of the scripting language that runs in web browsers is **ECMAScript**.


## II. <a id="section2"></a>History of JavaScript
You can read about the evolution of JavaScript & ECMAScript here:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript

In this course we are mostly concerned about the version of JavaScript that was standardized in 2009 called ECMAScript 5 (aka ES5), and the latest version (ES6) which was finalized in 2015. 
Because ES6 has not been full adopted by all of the browser vendors, we will only be using a small subset of its features.

You can peruse the full ES6 standard here - https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/ - but it's not very exciting reading.

A nice list of new ES6 language features is here - http://es6-features.org/ - and it will make more sense as you get comfortable with the JavaScript programming language.

There is a helpful ES6/Browser compatibility table here - https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

## III. <a id="section3"></a>Get started!

Let's go ahead and build a JavaScript "Hello World" application - it looks like this:

### hello-1.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>Hello-1</title>
   <script>
      console.log("Hello world!");
   </script>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

Note that JavaScript directives are contained in a &lt;script> tag. 

Go ahead and save this web page in an HTML file named hello-1.html and load it into the Chrome web browser - which will be the browser we will use in all of our examples going forward. 

The line of code - `console.log("Hello world!");` - doesn't do anything in the web browser window, but will instead be visible in the JavaScript console. We can see this console by right-clicking in the browser window and choosing **Inspect**. After that, choose the **Console** tab.

## IV. <a id="section4"></a>The JavaScript console is interactive
- This console also contains an interactive interpreter where you can run JavaScript commands. At the prompt, type `Date()` to create and see a new date from the `Date` object, and `Math.random()` to get a random number from the `Math` object.

![The JavaScript Console](_images/console-2.jpg)

- Note that the general term for an interactive console like this a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) - "Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop".

## V. <a id="section5"></a>Declaring variables and constants
We use the `const` keyword to declare constant values (that do not change), and the `let` keyword to declare variables. Note that we do not specify any *type* information when we declare the variable, and the JavaScript interpreter will infer the data type of the variable based on what value we assign to it.

Note that `const` and `let` are both part of the ES6 standard (you are learning some ES6 already!) and are well-supported by current and recent browsers.

### hello-2.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>Hello-2</title>
   <script>
     console.log("Hello world!");
     const answer = 42;
     // string concatenation
     console.log("The answer to everything is " + answer); 
	
     let x = 1;
     let y = 1;
     let sum = x + y;
     // string templating (ES6 only)
     console.log(`${x} + ${y} is ${sum}`); 
   </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

**Shows the following in the console:**

![The JavaScript Console](_images/console-3.jpg)

- Note above when strings are added to numbers, we get back a concatenated string. 
- Also see the *String Templating* used above - that's a newer ES6 feature that is more powerful than simple string concatenation. 
Note the backtick `` ` `` symbol is used to denote the string, and `${}` encloses the variable names.


## VI. <a id="section6"></a>Viewing error messages

The console will display error messages that will help you debug your code. Let's produce an error by attempting to change the value of the `answer` constant above.
Add this line of code - `answer = 43;` - right before the closing &lt;script> tag, and then reload the page. You should see an error in the console:

![The JavaScript Console](_images/console-4.jpg)

Now go ahead and fix the error by declaring `answer` as a variable rather than a constant (hint: use `let` instead of `const`).

## VII. <a id="section7"></a>JavaScript "Primitive" Data Types

The 5 common built-in "primitive" data types in JavaScript are: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Undefined` (a value has never been defined) and `Null` (the intentional absence of a value).

(ES6 has also added the `Symbol` type, which we probably won't need to use in this course.)

JavaScript is a *loosely typed* (aka *dynamic*) language. That means you don't have to declare the *type* of a variable ahead of time. The type will be determined automatically by the engine while the program is being run. 
That also means that the same variable can contain data of different types.

### hello-3.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>Hello-3</title>
   <script>
     // 5 fundamental JavaScript types
     let sum = 99; // Number
     let name = "Fred"; //String
     let isLoggedIn = false; // Boolean
     let userName = undefined;
     let data = null;

     // We can later change what type a variable contains
     sum = "Joe"; // sum now contains a String
     name = 50; // name now contains a Number

     console.log(sum); // "Joe"

</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

## VIII. <a id="section8"></a>JavaScript "Built-in" Objects

JavaScript also contains a number of built-in objects that we can use. There is `Object`, which is a starting point for our own customized objects, as well as `Array`, `Date`, `Math`, and others. The "primitive" types above also can be treated like objects and have properties and methods that can be called on them.

### hello-4.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <title>Hello-4</title>
   <script>
     // Common JS Objects
     let colors = ["red","green","blue"]; // Array literal
     let person = {name:"Fred",age:20};   // Object literal
     let month = new Date().getMonth(); 
     let age = Math.round(20.999);

     console.log(colors[0]);
     console.log(person.name);
     console.log(month);
     console.log(age);

     // Treat "primitives" like objects
     let sum = 99.980809809;             // Number
     let name = "Fred";                  // String
     let isLoggedIn = false;             // Boolean
     let userName = undefined;
     let data = null;

     console.log(sum.toFixed(2)); // 99.98
     console.log(name.length); // 4
     console.log(isLoggedIn.toString()); // "false"

</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

## IX. <a id="section9"></a>Nota bene 
1. In this document we have been using the ES6 "way" of  `let` and `const` to declare variables and constants. Out on the web you are commonly going to see the older (ES5 and earlier) `var` keyword used to declare variables. We recommend that you NOT use `var` to declare variables, as the variables that `var` declares are *scoped to functions*, rather than the *block scoping* of `let` and `const`, which introduces odd behavior. You can read some dicussion of this issue here: https://hackernoon.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-var-anymore-f109a58b9b70
1. The JavaScript `Number` can hold both a 64-bit number AND a 64-bit Integer - documentation on the finer points of this is here:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number
    - https://medium.com/dailyjs/javascripts-number-type-8d59199db1b6
1. JavaScript has 2 zeros `+0` and `-0` -  you can read about that here: https://abdulapopoola.com/2016/12/19/why-javascript-has-two-zeros-0-and-0/
1. We expect you to review the following programming structures on your own:
    - branching/conditionals such as [if...else](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), [switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch), and the [ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/conditional_operator)
    - repetitve constructs such as [for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for), [do...while](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while), and [while](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)
1. JavaScript has a large number of **truthy** and **falsy** values that are *coerced* to `true` or `false` in a boolean expression or context. Check out these links, and see the code sample below:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy

```javascript
// All of these are false values, excepting the last one - it turns out that "false" is true
console.log(0 == false ? "0 is false" : "0 is true");
console.log(-0 == false ? "-0 is false" : "-0 is true");
console.log(false == false ? "false is false" : "false is true");
console.log(null == false ? "null is false" : "null is true");
console.log(undefined == false ? "NaN is false" : "NaN is true");
console.log("" == false ? "\"\" is false" : "\"\" is true");
console.log('' == false ? "\'\' is false" : "\'\' is true");
console.log(new Boolean(false) == false ? "\"new Boolean(false)\" is false" : "\"new Boolean(false)\" is true");
console.log("false" == false ? "\"false\" is false" : "\"false\" is true");

/*
Basically, the first 8 values above are all coerced to *false* in a Boolean content.
Everything else - like the string "false" for example, is coerced to *true*.
*/
```

## XI. <a id="section11"></a>Review Exercise
Make a copy of **hello-4.html** and name it **web-apps-2-HW.html**. Delete all of the existing  `console.log()` calls, and add JavaScript that does the following (search the web for documentation if you don't know how to do these):

1. Use a method of the `Array` object to append another color to the end of the `colors` array.
1. Print out the last element in the `colors` array.
1. Loop through the `colors` array using a `for` loop and print out each value to the console.
1. Add a new property named `school` to the `person` object and give it a value of "RIT". Then print this value to the console.
1. Print out the number of seconds that have passed since 1970 - use the `Date` object.
1. Print out the value of pi - use the `Math` object.
1. Print out the absolute value of -999 - use the `Math` object.
1. Print out an "all caps" version of the string "Hello" - use a method of the `String` object.
